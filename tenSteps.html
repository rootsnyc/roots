<span style="color:#CB8436">1. Identify your stress triggers</span>
First things first, consider what exactly stresses you out? Do you know exactly what triggers this reaction? and how do you react to it? Once you have a few answers, determine what are possible solutions. You are not going to be able to take away every single stress trigger in your life, you can at least remove those that you would have an influence over. For example, if your morning commute is your main cause of stress because of traffic, then ask for a flexible schedule where you only have to commute fewer days out of week and other days from home.

<span style="color:#CB8436">2. Laugh</span>
Researcher Suzanne Steinbaum, cardiologist and director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, have found that laughing can significantly decrease stress hormones, reduce artery inflammation, and increase HDL, the “good” cholesterol. “Once you start laughing, it forces you to feel better,” said Dr. Steinbaum. Even though we all have different senses of humor, think about things that put a smile on your face. Is it an old SNL sketch, viral video of a cat chasing a mouse, or reminiscing about that time your best friends got caught sleeping in class? Whatever you think of, make it easily accessible for times when you're stressed and need a good laugh.
</p>
    
<p>
<span style="color:#CB8436">3. Eat well</span>
Our moods and the things we eat are linked. So, when you feel down and stressed out you tend to reach for your comfort food. Regardless, chips for breakfast is never the best option health wise. Sure, Pizza is delicious and may temporarily make you feel better but eating it daily will not. Add some mixed vegetables to your plate next time. You can slowly incorporate a new way of eating into your routine. Healthy eating improves your energy, increases productivity, and improves your physical and mental health. It can also help save you money. Avoid junk and processed food and go with foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed, fruits and veggies.

<span style="color:#CB8436">4. WOOP, there it is!</span>
Everyone talks about how positive thinking can help reduce stress. But, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen, author of Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside The New Science Of Motivation, makes way for a new theory. That positive thinking isn’t the only source to becoming less stressed. Gabriele strongly affirms that fantasizing is temporary and counterproductive. Instead, she introduces that we should use a mental contrasting tool she calls
WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan). By closing your eyes, imagining your wish coming true for a few minutes, and then thinking about the main obstacle that’s in your way. From that, envision the steps that you would take to remove the obstacle.

<p>
<span style="color:#CB8436">5. Buy a plant</span>
Yes, plants are more than just beautiful. They are a good source of air purifiers, which can also reduce stress and anxiety. Eating, smelling, and planting certain plants may greatly impact your general well-being. Plants help alleviate symptoms because they promote higher quality air. Improving the quality of air helps improve the quality of your health. Consider buying these types of plants to help you unwind and to welcome new positive energy into your home -chamomile, jasmine, lavender, succulents, marjoram, and skullcap, air plant, calathea, ZZ plants, parlor palms, and snake plants.

<span style="color:#CB8436">6. Seriously, Turn Off Your Phone</span>
Smartphones, in particular, are linked to increased stress, as more and more people feel pressure to respond to messages at all times or they become depressed due to social media, with apps such as Instagram. Try turning off your phone for a couple of hours or deactivating your account for a while to give yourself personal time.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#CB8436">7. Put on Some Music</span>
Experts say classical music has a soothing effect. As in, it slows heart rates, lowers blood pressure and even decreases levels of stress hormones. Music that you love will flood your brain with feel-good neurochemicals like dopamine. Music reduces everyday stressors, research shows that it’s particularly beneficial for those in the midst of stressful events, like surgery.
No headphones? Try humming or single the lyrics to one of your favorite songs. So, turn up the volume and get listening!

<span style="color:#CB8436">8. Light a Candle</span>

Lavender, Neroli, Rose ,Frankincense, Vetiver, Sandalwood, Bergamot, Ylang Ylang, Roman, Orange Blossom, Chamomile, Geranium.

<span style="color:#CB8436">9. Practice Mindfulness</span>
Mindfulness describes practices that keep you in touch with the present moment. It can help combat the anxiety-inducing effects of negative thinking .There are various amount of ways to help make you aware and increase mindfulness, such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga and meditation. I would suggest reading The HeadSpace Guide: Meditation Mindfulness by author Andy Puddicombe.

<span style="color:#CB8436">10. Have a Hot Bath</span>
Heat is known for relaxing the muscle and taking a long hot bath can be soothing for the mind. Plus having a calming atmosphere allows for a temporary feeling of escape from everyday stressors. So, stock up on your soaps and bath salts, get a head resting bath pillow, dim the lights and decorate the room with candles for extra aromatherapy. Get creative and make an in-home spa, you can even add in spa treatments like facials.

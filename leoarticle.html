        <h1>Women in Harlem: A Conversation with Leo</h1>
        <h4>Taneisha Bailey</h4>

<p>
Leo was born and raised in Harlem, New York on 155th and Saint Nicholas Ave. She is
26 years old and identifies as an Afro- Latina. She has lived in New York City her whole life and believes that Black and Latina women are victims in her community when it comes to receiving adequate health care assistance as well as wellness resources. Our organization ROOTS decided to talk with Leo to understand her perspective on what is needed within her community to live a healthy base lifestyle mentally and physically. This is her story and experiences and we are here to support and bring to light what was women don’t share or talk about. In this interview you would read what matters most to women of colors living in areas where they do not have enough resources..
</p>
            
<p class="interviewer">
TB: What can you tell me about Harlem?
</p>
    
<p>
L: Well I love Harlem. I have been here my whole life. I’ve seen how my neighborhood changed from being predominantly African-American to now a multicultural community of different races, but it’s also becoming heavily gentrified as more and more luxury buildings are being built and more high end shopping centers and restaurants are opening up. Harlem is the birthplace of creativity; it's the heart of my people and the soul of my ancestors. Those who know Harlem before all of the glitz and glamor can tell you we as a community came a long way.

<p class="interviewer">
TB: Do you know of any safe spaces or places that offer support to women of color who live in Harlem?
</p>

<p>
L: There aren’t a lot of places that are dedicated to helping women in Harlem I just know there’s a few shelters and there’s a mental health clinic nearby but it’s not a place where a lot of women go.
</p>  
            
<p class="interviewer">
TB: Why don’t a lot of women go to these clinics or mental health facilities?
</p>
            
<p>
L: A lot of the women in my area don’t trust these places they don’t feel comfortable enough to share with these people their issues or health problems. They rather deal with their issues on their own then to go somewhere and become diagnose with a disorder then force to take all this medication that they can’t even afford and I don’t feel like they’re really being listen to or heard.
</p>  
            
<p class="interviewer">
TB: Is it common for black and Latina women to be unheard within their own community?
</p>
            
<p>            
L: It’s very common for Spanish women and Black women to not be heard. We are the biggest unprotected race and gender of all time. A Lot of people don’t want to hear our struggles. A lot of people don’t want to help us or care to help us. So if we want to be heard, we have to go to the extremes and most of the time that costs us our lives and freedom.
</p>
            
<p class="interviewer">
TB: So with that in mind do you have any access to digital or print resources that help promote self-care for women of color?
</p>
            
<p>            
L: There’s Instagram. I see a lot of video clips and Instagram posts of different women organizations that post tips on how to handle stress, how to handle being a woman of color, how to take care of yourself, a lot of self-care tips. Me personally, I don’t read a lot of magazines but sometimes I do look through seventeen magazine because they have all these cute girl clothes and products and sometimes they have articles where they talk about situations that young girls go through and how to get through those tough situations but besides those two I don’t know of any other material that Is dedicated to helping women of color.
</p>  
            
<p class="interviewer">
TB: Are you a firm believer in eating well, do you think that eating well contributes to having a healthy mind?
</p>
            
<p>            
L: Most definitely I make it a priority to eat things that are good for me no matter how much they cost I think that a lot of women who live in low income areas don’t have access to good food so it makes them carry the energy of not feeling good inside, they feel depressed a lot and I always tell my friends to make sure you’re eating all your greens and all your vegetables and your fruits
because if you don’t you’re going to be in a bad mood and they all laugh at me but I’m being super serious. Eating well has such a strong effect on your mind and your physical state.
</p>   
   
<p class="interviewer">
TB: What helps you destress at home?
</p>
                     
<p>            
L: I use a lot of aromatherapy when things smell good it makes me feel better. I like to burn incense; I like to read books. Like meditation books. I also like to smoke marijuana from time to time, I also like to drink tea and go outside to the park.
</p> 
            
<p class="interviewer">
  TB: Do you ever worry about where you can go and receive feminine products like tampons, make up, body care?        
</p>

<p>L: Are you asking if I can get products?</p>
            
<p class="interviewer">TB: Yes, like do you have a hard time having access to these products?</p>

<p>L: Not really, I mean I can go to my corner store and find tampons, Advil, soap it’s just not going to be good quality products, but I can definitely get those products.</p>
            
<p class="interviewer">TB: What makes you feel empowered?</p>

<p>L: Honestly being a mom makes me feel empowered being able to provide for them, love them, help them grow... makes me feel like I am doing what I’m supposed to do. I'm doing what’s right and that makes me a mother.</p>

<p class="interviewer">TB: That’s beautiful, I’m sure you're a great mother.</p>

<p>L: I try to be, it's hard sometimes.</p>

<p class="interviewer">TB: I can imagine, so overall you feel like you have a good sense of control over your life and mental health?

<p>L: Overall yes, but there are times where it can be a struggle to have everything together. Especially if you are a single mother with no help. If there were more resources around me. Like
free day care centers i trust or just a place where I can be myself and talk about my problems. That would help me maintain a healthy mindset.</p>

<p class="interviewer">TB: You've been a pleasure to interview and your feedback and answers are very informative. I want to thank you Leo for allowing ROOTS to interview you. If you have any questions or would like a link to how this interview is being used just send me an email. Thank you for your time.   </p>
